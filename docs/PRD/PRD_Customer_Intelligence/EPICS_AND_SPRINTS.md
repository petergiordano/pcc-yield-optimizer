## 🚧 Prototype Scope Note

**This sprint plan covers Phase 0-1 ONLY** (CourtReserve integration + Customer Intelligence foundation).

**Prototype deliverables** (6 weeks):
- Standalone CIC dashboard at `/prototypes/cic-dashboard/index.html`
- CourtReserve CSV import workflow
- 4-segment classification with multi-source confidence
- Corporate connector table with ICP scoring
- Data coverage dashboard

**Out of scope for prototype**:
- Phase 2: Best practice research (programming ideas library)
- Phase 3: Yield management (scenario planner, event decision tool, mezzanine ROI)
- Integration with existing Yield Optimizer (deferred to Phase 2)

**When to Use This Document**:
- Sprint planning sessions
- Daily standups (task tracking)
- User story refinement
- Effort estimation
- Acceptance criteria validation

**How This Differs from Other Specs**:
- PRD/Functional/Technical/Design = **WHAT** to build
