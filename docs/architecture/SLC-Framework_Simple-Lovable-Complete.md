# The SLC Framework: Simple, Lovable, Complete


The SLC framework-Simple, Lovable, and Complete-is a modern alternative to the traditional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach. It’s designed to help you build web apps and tools that users actually want to use from day one, without sacrificing quality for speed[1](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/)[4](https://helio.app/product-discovery/minimum-viable-product-alternatives/slc/)[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-products-simple-lovable-complete-way-mark-donnigan-p65ic).

SLC is about building apps that are easy to use, delightful, and fully deliver on their promise-even if they’re small. Use your AI tools to accelerate, but always sanity-check for simplicity, lovability, and completeness before shipping[1](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/)[4](https://helio.app/product-discovery/minimum-viable-product-alternatives/slc/)[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-products-simple-lovable-complete-way-mark-donnigan-p65ic).

# Simple

* Focus on a core value proposition: Do one thing (or a tightly related set of things) exceptionally well.  
* Prioritize ruthlessly: Only include features essential to delivering your main promise.  
* Make it intuitive: The UI/UX should be easy to understand and use, with minimal friction[1](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/)[4](https://helio.app/product-discovery/minimum-viable-product-alternatives/slc/)[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-products-simple-lovable-complete-way-mark-donnigan-p65ic).

# Lovable

* Delight users: Add small touches that evoke positive emotions-beautiful design, satisfying interactions, or thoughtful details.  
* Solve real pain: Address a genuine need in a way that feels novel or especially considerate.  
* Gather feedback: Listen to users and inject personality or delight where it matters most[4](https://helio.app/product-discovery/minimum-viable-product-alternatives/slc/)[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-products-simple-lovable-complete-way-mark-donnigan-p65ic).

# Complete

* Fulfill your promise: The product should fully solve the main problem it sets out to address, with no major gaps.  
* Avoid “embarrassing” releases: Unlike MVPs, SLC products are ready for real users-even if they’re simple, they’re not half-baked.  
* Ensure standalone value: If you never add another feature, users should still find it genuinely useful[1](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/)[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-products-simple-lovable-complete-way-mark-donnigan-p65ic).

# SLC in Practice: Guide for Vibe Coding Sessions

## 1\. Define the Core

* What’s the single most important problem your app/tool solves?  
* What are the absolute must-have features to deliver that value?

## 2\. Ruthlessly Prioritize

* List all desired features, then cut anything not essential for the initial promise.  
* Ask: “If this feature was missing, would the product still be lovable and complete?”

## 3\. Design for Delight

* Identify one or two small ways to surprise or delight users (e.g., a friendly onboarding, a clever animation, or a helpful default).  
* Keep the UI clean and focused.

## 4\. Ensure Completeness

* Walk through the user journey: Are there any dead ends or missing pieces?  
* Beta test with real users and gather feedback on gaps or frustrations[4](https://helio.app/product-discovery/minimum-viable-product-alternatives/slc/).

## 5\. Iterate with Feedback

* Use your AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, v0.dev, bolt.new) to quickly prototype and refine.  
* Incorporate user feedback to polish lovable and complete aspects before launch.

# SLC Checklist for Your Environment

* **Platform:** macOS (MacBook Pro M2, 32GB RAM)  
* **Editor:** VS Code (with relevant extensions for your stack)[2](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)  
* **AI Tools:** ChatGPT Plus, Claude Max (Claude Code), v0.dev, bolt.new for rapid prototyping and code generation3  
* **Workflow:**

  * Use AI assistants to scaffold and iterate on features, but always sanity-check for completeness and usability.  
  * Leverage RAG (retrieval augmented generation) techniques if your AI tools need up-to-date documentation or external knowledge3.  
  * Keep each coding session focused on delivering a simple, lovable, and complete increment.

# Example SLC Session Outline

1. **Kickoff:** Define the problem and core promise.  
2. **Feature Cut:** List and trim features to essentials.  
3. **Prototype:** Use AI tools to scaffold the core.  
4. **Polish:** Add one delightful touch.  
5. **Test:** Walk through the user flow-fix any gaps.  
6. **Feedback:** Share with a user, gather insights, refine.

# SLC Session Template

*For Simple, Lovable, Complete Product Development*

## 1\. Session Overview

* Date:  
* Project/App Name:  
* Facilitator(s):  
* Participants:  
* Session Goal:  
  *(e.g., “Deliver a simple, lovable, and complete version of the onboarding flow”)*

## 2\. Define the Core

* What problem are we solving?  
  *(One sentence, user-focused)*  
* What is the core value proposition?  
  *(What must this app/tool do to be useful and complete?)*

## 3\. Ruthless Prioritization

* Must-Have Features:  
  *(List only the features absolutely required for the core value)*  
* Nice-to-Have Features (for later):  
  *(List features to defer or cut for now)*  
* Out of Scope:  
  *(Explicitly state what you are not building in this session)*

## 4\. Design for Simplicity & Delight

* How will we keep the UI/UX simple?  
  *(List principles, e.g., “One primary action per screen”)*  
* What’s one delightful touch we can add?  
  *(e.g., friendly copy, micro-animation, smart default, etc.)*

## 5\. Build & Prototype

* Tech Stack:  
  *(e.g., Next.js, React, Tailwind, Supabase, etc.)*  
* AI Tools to Use:  
  *(e.g., ChatGPT for code review, v0.dev for UI scaffolding, Claude for code generation)*  
* Development Steps:  
  1. Scaffold core features  
  2. Implement delightful touch  
  3. Polish UI/UX  
  4. Sanity-check for completeness

## 6\. Completeness Check

* User Journey Walkthrough:  
  * Start to finish: Are there any dead ends, missing steps, or confusing flows?  
  * Does the product fully deliver on the core promise?  
* Beta Test:  
  * Who will test?  
  * How will feedback be collected? *(e.g., Loom video, Google Form, live chat)*

## 7\. Feedback & Iteration

* Feedback Summary:  
  *(List key insights, issues, or opportunities for improvement)*  
* Quick Fixes:  
  *(What can we address before wrapping up?)*  
* Next Steps:  
  *(What’s next for the product? What’s the next SLC increment?)*

## 8\. Session Retrospective

* What went well?  
* What could be improved?  
* Any blockers or learnings for next time?

## Tips for SLC Sessions

* Keep it focused: One core problem, one lovable touch, one complete flow.  
* Use your AI tools: Let ChatGPT, Claude, v0.dev, or bolt.new handle boilerplate and accelerate iteration.  
* Celebrate completeness: Don’t ship “almost done”-ship something that feels finished, even if small.
