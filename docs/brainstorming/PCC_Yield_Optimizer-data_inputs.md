The Yield Optimizer is a strategic go to market app enabling the management team to maximize profitable growth for the business while maintaining 99th percentile of customer satisfaction, which leads to: 

1. High revenue per customer and increases over time  
2. High customer lifetime value  
3. High organic growth through word of mouth and referrals  
4. Keeping customer acquisition costs low  
5. Keeping operation and management costs low 

Imagine you have access to all of the data listed in all of the tables below (and even data I forgot) and dream up an elegant, easy to use, and incredibly powerful tool to support analysis and drive insights by overlaying data to identify patterns, signals, opportunities, etc. 


## Priorities

We need the PCC Yield Optimizer to provide the analysis and insights to help us achieve the following:

1. **First priority is driving memberships to lock in recurring revenue**. We also need to determine the maximum number of memberships to achieve, leaving enough room for non-members to pay to play (more profitable).   
   1. Where are customers playing when they are not at PCC? Why do they go there? For example, I spoke with Randall who decided to play at a competitor on a Friday night because they had a fun themed event and he “liked the social atmosphere and fun” on a Friday.   
2. **Second priority is Yield Optimization**. We need guidance on how to decide what trade offs to make in terms of play time, tournaments, training and lessons, corporate/private events. While these are more profitable, they “eat” into available play time for members and non members.

## Current Memberships 

We have annual memberships: [https://www.pickleballclub.house/annual-membership](https://www.pickleballclub.house/annual-membership) and monthly memberships: [https://www.pickleballclub.house/membership-monthly](https://www.pickleballclub.house/membership-monthly)

In addition, non-members can show up and “pay to play”.

So I think there are two categories of customers: member and non-member.

Non-member customers are more lucrative, however if we have too many that might have a negative impact on the experience for members, e.g. lack of court availability. 

## Strategic Decision Support Examples

The PCC Yield Optimizer app should enable data-driven decisions about:

Operational Planning

- When to schedule special events (during low-traffic competitor hours)  
- Optimal staffing levels by day and hour  
- Marketing campaign timing (target competitor peak times with promotions)

Pricing Strategy

- Identify premium time slots (high demand across market)  
- Find opportunities for off-peak discounts  
- Understand price-sensitive vs. price-insensitive time blocks

Capacity Planning

- See when the market overall is busiest  
- Identify growth opportunities in underserved time slots  
- Plan expansion based on unmet demand patterns

Competitive Positioning

- Understand your strengths vs. competitors  
- Identify competitive gaps in the market  
- Track market share indicators over time

Marketing Intelligence

- Know when competitors are at capacity (opportunity to capture overflow)  
- Identify loyal customer time blocks (consistent high traffic)  
- Target messaging for specific time slots

### Real-World Use Cases

Example 1: "Should we offer a Tuesday morning league?"

- Check Day Comparison Chart → See Tuesday morning traffic across all competitors  
- Check Competitive Comparison → See if market is underserved at that time  
- Decision: If competitors are quiet, there's opportunity

Example 2: "Why is our Saturday revenue lower than expected?"

- Check Weekly Heatmap → See Saturday peak times  
- Compare vs. competitors' Saturday patterns  
- Identify if you're missing peak hours or if market is slow

Example 3: "When should we schedule maintenance?"

- Check all facilities' low-traffic periods  
- Find common quiet hours across market  
- Schedule during market-wide slow periods

Example 4: "Should we expand to weekday afternoons?"

- Export CSV data for detailed analysis  
- Compare weekday afternoon traffic across all facilities  
- Build business case with actual market data

## What I think Yield Management Means

The main asset of the PCC are the courts, and like seat on an airplane, we want to fill all open operating hours as efficiently as possible, at the highest profit, while maintaining superior customer experience and satisfaction. 

Importantly, at the end of the day PCC has 7 courts and there are only 24 hours in a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. That represents the total availability of courts to monetize. Of course we need to back out availability for when the facility is closed, for when courts are in maintenance, holidays etc. 

**Current Operating Hours (does NOT include holidays)**

* **Monday:** 8 AM – 9 PM  
* **Tuesday:** 8 AM – 9 PM  
* **Wednesday:** 8 AM – 9 PM  
* **Thursday:** 8 AM – 9 PM  
* **Friday:** 8 AM – 9 PM  
* **Saturday:** 7 AM – 7 PM  
* **Sunday:** 7 AM – 5 PM

### Trade offs abound

Any training, events or promotions we run are essentially trade-offs for customer paying court time. For example, if we host a corporate event on a couple of courts on a Thursday evening, that means those courts are not available to customers (members and non-members). So we have to optimize corporate events for when they happen, how much we charge, and how many we allow, etc so as not to negatively impact the customer experience due to lack of court time. 

Likewise, we have a Pro who gives lessons to members and non-members. That training time is lucrative for our business, but once again it is a trade off for other uses of the court.
