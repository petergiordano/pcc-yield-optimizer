### **Pickleball Clubhouse Chicago \- GTM Engine**

Gemini [Chat Session](https://gemini.google.com/u/0/app/da35ccee5d77f749)

Core premise: We’re not running a pickleball club; we’re building a data-driven, scalable, and highly lucrative business that uses a physical product—the clubhouse—as its primary asset.

# **Part 1: The Foundation — GTM Hypothesis & Positioning**

The most critical phase, establishing a clear, single-minded strategic hypothesis.

Move from a "all-things-to-all-people" stance to a disciplined and focused GTM system.

* **The Core "Product":** The product is not just court time. It is a **premium, integrated venue for corporate wellness, team-building, and social events.** The unique assets are the 7 courts, the 2-5 flexible rooms, and the mezzanine space.  
* **The GTM Hypothesis:** The business is the premier venue in the Chicago area for providing a unique, active, and social experience that is perfect for corporate clients.  
* **The Value Proposition:** "The business is the premier venue for corporate team-building, providing a complete wellness and social experience that boosts team morale and engagement far more effectively than traditional happy hours or office gatherings."  
* **Customer Segmentation & Strategy:** Customers must be intentionally segmented to avoid a poor experience for all. Time-based segmentation (Beginner Hours vs. Advanced Hours) and defined customer archetypes (the Corporate Client, the Fitness Enthusiast, the Social Player) should be used.

# **Part 2: Deep Research & Data Platform**

This phase is about moving from assumptions to facts. It involves building a data-driven understanding of the market and existing customers, which will serve as the foundation for the entire GTM system.

## **MECE List of Deep Research Reports to Run**

1. **Industry-Level Analysis:** Understand the broader competitive landscape.  
   * **Goal:** Define the market and identify key trends.  
   * **Questions to Answer:** What are the major market trends? What are the common business and revenue models of similar facilities? What are the operational benchmarks for profitability and staffing?  
2. **Local Competitive Analysis:** Get granular on direct and indirect rivals.  
   * **Goal:** Identify true competitors and pinpoint the unique positioning.  
   * **Questions to Answer:** Who are the direct and indirect rivals? What are their specific offerings and pricing? How active is the local tournament and event scene?  
3. **Local Demographic and Business Mapping:** Understand the physical market.  
   * **Goal:** Identify potential customers for the B2B and B2C GTM channels.  
   * **Questions to Answer:** What are the residential demographics around the facility? What are the major businesses and corporate offices nearby? Which HR departments are ideal targets for the GTM motion?  
4. **AI Engine Perception & "Digital Body Language" (Advanced AEO):** This is critical for understanding how AI and search engines semantically interpret the business and its competitors. It's about how the digital footprint communicates with and is understood by the AI that now mediates a huge portion of customer discovery.  
5. **Uncovering Latent "Hidden Gems" & Underleveraged Assets:** This goes beyond what is publicly stated and looks for the unique, often uncelebrated, internal or community assets that could be a source of competitive advantage.

## **MECE List of Data & Information to Gather**

This is the most critical asset. It involves moving from just knowing who has paid to a highly detailed profile of the customers.

# **Part 3: The GTM Engine & Business Model**

This is the phase where a predictable, repeatable, and scalable system for acquiring high-value customers is built. It is also where all revenue-generating models are leveraged.

## **GTM Channels**

1. **The Corporate Sales Engine (Primary GTM Channel):** This is the most lucrative and defensible channel.  
   * **Go-to-Market:** Use enriched data to create a warm list of companies. Approach HR departments with a personalized, data-backed message.  
   * **The Simulator's Role:** Model the ROI of this channel. Calculate if the revenue from corporate events and discounted memberships justifies the cost of a dedicated sales effort.  
2. **The Differentiated Funnel (Scalable Lead Engine):** This is how new customers are attracted and moved into the GTM engine.  
   * **Strategy:** Use time-based segmentation to create a welcoming environment for all. The goal is to get new people in the door to capture their data for enrichment.  
   * **Communication:** The mailing list is a highly differentiated **GTM channel.** Use customer segmentation data to send targeted, value-added content instead of generic promotions.

## **Revenue Models & Yield Management**

1. **Core Revenue Models:**  
   * **Membership-Based:** Provides predictable, stable revenue.  
   * **Pay-Per-Use:** Captures high-margin revenue from non-members and fills courts during peak hours. Use **dynamic pricing** to maximize revenue per court hour.  
   * **Corporate & Strategic Partnerships:** A predictable B2B revenue stream and a high-volume GTM channel.  
2. **Ancillary Revenue Models:**  
   * **Events, Leagues, and Tournaments:** High-margin revenue generators and brand builders.  
   * **Services and Programming:** High-margin offerings (lessons, clinics) that "feed the funnel" by turning new customers into loyal ones.  
   * **Retail & Food & Beverage:** Revenue boosters that enhance the customer experience.

# **Part 4: Addressing Blind Spots & Building the Moat**

A B2B SaaS GTM lens can miss critical elements of a physical business. This section ensures the business is not only scalable but also difficult to replicate.

1. **The Product is the "Vibe":** The ultimate retention engine is the social experience.  
   * **Novel Insight:** Operational excellence and social programming are competitive moats. It is not sufficient to just simulate GTM; the impact of investments in the facility's atmosphere and staff must also be simulated.  
   * **The Simulator's Role:** Add a variable for "Social Programming Investment" and model its impact on a "Customer Satisfaction Score," which, in turn, impacts referral rates and member churn.  
2. **The GTM Flywheel is Driven by Local Network Effects:** Word-of-mouth is a channel that can be measured and influenced.  
   * **Novel Insight:** The most satisfied members are the best salespeople.  
   * **The Simulator's Role:** The simulator should model a "Net Promoter Score" metric. When it hits a certain threshold, it automatically increases the number of "new member referrals" in the subsequent quarter, lowering the effective Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

# **Part 5: The Simulator as a GTM Validation Tool**

The simulator is a critical utility for ensuring disciplined choices are being made. It's the engine for the "Keep, Change, Kill" framework.

* **Inputs:** All of the data and variables from the previous phases.  
* **Key Metrics:**  
  * **Segment-Specific Revenue:** Who is the most profitable customer?  
  * **Court Utilization per Segment:** Is the segmentation strategy working?  
  * **CAC & LTV:** Is the GTM engine profitable on a per-customer basis?  
  * **Financial Runway:** How does each strategic choice impact the runway?  
* **Final Output:** The simulator will generate clear financial and GTM projections, providing the data needed for investor presentations and for making disciplined choices.
