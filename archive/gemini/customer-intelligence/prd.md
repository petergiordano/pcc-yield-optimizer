## 1. Executive Summary

The PCC Yield Optimizer currently excels at **supply-side analysis**—identifying *when* and *where* market opportunities exist by tracking competitor utilization. However, it lacks **demand-side intelligence**. The business cannot effectively answer foundational questions about its own customers: **WHO** are they, **WHY** do they choose PCC, and **HOW** can we best serve them to maximize both revenue and retention.

This document outlines the vision for a **Customer Intelligence Center**, a platform that will transform raw member data into actionable insights. It will enable data-driven decisions on everything from marketing and amenity investments to court allocation and pricing.

By understanding our customers, we can move from broad assumptions to precise, segment-driven strategies that balance short-term revenue with long-term customer lifetime value (CLV). This initiative will be executed in three distinct phases, each delivering standalone value, to manage complexity and ensure stakeholder alignment.

## 2. Product Goals and Objectives

### Primary Business Goals
- **Increase Revenue by 15-25%:** Achieved through optimized pricing, targeted corporate event sales, and data-validated amenity offerings.
- **Reduce Member Churn by 20%:** Proactively identify at-risk members and address the root causes of dissatisfaction, such as poor court access for high-value segments.
- **Improve Marketing ROI by 30%:** Shift from broad, demographic-based campaigns to highly-targeted lookalike audiences and neighborhood-specific promotions.

### Key Product Objectives
- **Answer Foundational Customer Questions:** Provide clear, data-backed answers to "Who are our customers?" and "Why do they play at PCC?".
- **Develop Actionable Customer Segments:** Group the member base into meaningful segments (e.g., "Corporate Power Users," "Social Ambassadors") to tailor services and marketing.
- **Integrate Customer Value into Business Decisions:** Create tools that explicitly weigh immediate revenue against the calculated churn cost and CLV of affected members.
- **Provide a Clear Roadmap for Growth:** Model the impact of growing the member base on satisfaction and provide a data-driven plan for capacity expansion.

## 3. User Personas and Problem Statements

### Persona: Christy (Business Owner / Operator)

Christy is responsible for the overall health of the business, from daily operations to long-term strategy. She is constantly making decisions with incomplete information.

**Problem Statements:**

- *"I need to decide whether to accept a $500 corporate event that displaces 12 members, but I don't know if those members are irreplaceable power users or casual drop-ins. I'm flying blind and risk alienating my best customers."*
- *"I want to invest in our mezzanine, but I don't know if I should build a yoga studio for our 'wellness' crowd or a strength training area for our 'competitive' players. I'm guessing what my members actually want."*
- *"I'm asked to approve marketing campaigns targeting '25-35 year olds,' but I don't know where my most profitable members actually live or work, so our ad spend is inefficient."*
- *"I know some members are unhappy about court availability, but I don't know how close we are to a 'churn cliff' where a small increase in members leads to mass frustration."*

## 4. Detailed Features and Functionality

This project will be delivered in three major phases, each representing a key milestone.

### **Phase 1: Foundational Customer Insights (The "Simple" Milestone)**

**Goal:** Answer the most urgent "who" and "why" questions using a lean, manual-first approach to prove value and gather foundational data.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| F-1.1 | Member Visit Frequency Analysis | Ingest booking data to produce a simple analysis (e.g., a histogram) of how often members visit per month. This identifies "regulars" vs. "casuals". |
| F-1.2 | Manual Customer Survey Module | A simple interface or process to ingest results from a short, targeted customer survey (e.g., from a Google Form) covering motivations, amenity interest, and corporate event potential. |
| F-1.3 | Manual Corporate Connector List | A feature to display a manually researched list of high-potential "Corporate Connectors"—members who work at large or nearby companies. |
| F-1.4 | Competitor Event Research | A process to research and catalog the types of events and programming offered by the most successful pickleball clubs nationwide to generate ideas for PCC. |

### **Phase 2: Automated Intelligence & Visualization (The "Lovable" Milestone)**

**Goal:** Automate the data pipelines and present the enriched customer intelligence in beautiful, interactive dashboards.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| F-2.1 | Automated Data Enrichment Pipeline | Integrate with a third-party API (e.g., Clearbit) to automatically enrich member profiles with firmographic and demographic data (employer, job title, location). |
| F-2.2 | Dynamic Customer Segmentation Engine | An automated engine that uses clustering algorithms (k-means) on behavioral and enriched data to dynamically assign each member to a segment (e.g., "Corporate Power Users," "Social Ambassadors"). |
| F-2.3 | Interactive Segment Dashboard | A dashboard that visualizes the member base across the defined segments, showing counts, average LTV, and key characteristics for each. |
| F-2.4 | Demographic & Member Heatmap | An interactive map overlay that displays U.S. Census demographic data (income, etc.) and can be layered with a heatmap of where specific customer segments live. |

### **Phase 3: Integrated Yield Management (The "Complete" Milestone)**

**Goal:** Connect customer intelligence directly to the business's operational and revenue decisions, creating a true yield optimization engine.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| F-3.1 | Corporate Event Decision Tool | A tool that, for any event inquiry, calculates the trade-off between the event's revenue and the estimated churn cost based on the CLV of the displaced members. It will provide an "Accept," "Decline," or "Counter-offer" recommendation. |
| F-3.2 | Segment-Aware Dynamic Pricing | A pricing engine that recommends different drop-in prices for different times of day based not only on demand but also on which customer segments are most likely to book. |
| F-3.3 | Segment-Based Court Allocation | A planning tool that recommends how to allocate court time, reserving a certain percentage of prime-time slots for high-value member segments to ensure booking access and reduce churn. |
| F-3.4 | Data-Driven Mezzanine ROI Planner | An interactive calculator to model the ROI of potential mezzanine investments, weighted by real member interest data gathered from surveys. |
