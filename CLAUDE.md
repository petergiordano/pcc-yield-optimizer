## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GitHub Integration Protocol

### Mandatory Issue Tracking

**ALL new features, enhancements, and bugs MUST be tracked via GitHub Issues using the GitHub Integration Protocol.**

**Issue Creation Requirements:**

1. **When to Create Issues:**
   - Any new feature for CIC prototype or future phases
   - Any enhancement to existing functionality
   - Any bug or defect discovered
   - Technical debt or refactoring work
   - Work items from EPICS_AND_SPRINTS.md user stories

2. **Issue Types & Prefixes:**
   - **Features**: `FEAT-XXX` - New functionality
   - **Enhancements**: `ENH-XXX` - Improvements to existing features
   - **Bugs**: `BUG-XXX` - Defects or issues

3. **How to Create Issues:**

   **Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)**
   ```
   1. Navigate to: https://github.com/petergiordano/pcc-yield-optimizer/issues/new/choose
   2. Select "Feature Request" or "Bug Report" template
   3. Fill in structured form:
      - Title (auto-prefixed)
      - Description
      - Phase (1-5)
      - Priority (low/medium/high/critical)
      - Acceptance Criteria
      - Technical Notes
   ```

   **Method 2: CLI (Bash 3.2+ compatible)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-feature-issue.sh "Title" "Description" "Phase 1" "high"
   ./scripts/create-bug-issue.sh "Title" "Description" "critical"
   ./scripts/create-enhancement-issue.sh "Title" "Description" "Phase 2" "medium"
   ```

4. **Phase Mapping:**
   - **Phase 1**: CourtReserve data integration + Customer segmentation (current)
   - **Phase 2**: Integration with main Yield Optimizer app
   - **Phase 3**: Best practices research & programming ideas library
   - **Phase 4**: Yield management tools (scenario planner, event decision tool)
   - **Phase 5**: Future enhancements

5. **Issue Content Requirements:**
   - **Clear Title**: Concise, action-oriented
   - **Detailed Description**: What, why, and context
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable, testable conditions
   - **Technical Notes**: Implementation details, file references, spec links
   - **Spec References**: Link to relevant PRD/Functional/Technical spec sections

6. **Automation:**
   - GitHub Action automatically labels issues based on prefix
   - Issues automatically added to GitHub Project #1
   - Labels applied: type (feature/bug/enhancement), phase, priority

### Example Issue Creation

**User Request:**
"We need to add a date range filter to the CIC dashboard"

**Claude's Response:**
```markdown
I'll help you create an issue for this enhancement.

**Issue Details:**
- Type: Enhancement (ENH prefix)
- Title: Add date range filter to CIC dashboard
- Phase: Phase 1
- Priority: Medium

**Description:**
The CIC dashboard currently shows all-time data. Adding a date range filter
will allow users to analyze customer behavior patterns within specific time periods.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Date range picker component in sidebar
- [ ] Filter applies to all dashboard charts
- [ ] Presets for common ranges (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days, Custom)
- [ ] State persists in URL query params

**Technical Notes:**
- Update `prototypes/cic-dashboard/js/components/filters.js`
- Integrate with existing segment filter logic
- Reference: FUNCTIONAL_SPEC_CIC_Prototype.md Section FR-1.3 (Filter Requirements)
- Reference: DESIGN_SPEC_Customer_Intelligence.md Section 6.2 (Filter Patterns)

Would you like me to create this issue via the GitHub web interface?
```

## Development Guidelines

### Prototype-First Approach

**Current Strategy**: Build isolated prototype in `/prototypes/cic-dashboard/` before integration.

**Why?**
- Validate CourtReserve data model without disrupting production
- Iterate quickly on customer segmentation algorithms
- Demonstrate value before full integration
- Minimize risk (3-4 weeks integration vs. 1-2 weeks prototype)

**See**: `docs/strategy/PROTOTYPE_STRATEGY.md` for detailed phased approach

### Code Organization

**Prototype Development:**
- All CIC prototype work in `/prototypes/cic-dashboard/`
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) + D3.js for consistency
- Static JSON data files (manual CSV â†’ JSON conversion)
- No backend API for Phase 1
- Standalone deployment (no dependencies on main app)

**Integration Phase (Phase 2):**
- Migrate validated prototype components to main app
- Integrate with existing data layer
- Add "Customer Intel" tab to main navigation
- Connect to CourtReserve data pipeline

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- D3.js v7 (charts, visualizations)
- Leaflet 1.9 (geographic visualizations)
- CSS3 + Custom Properties

**Data Sources:**
- CourtReserve CSV exports (weekly)
- Census API (demographics)
- Social media APIs (future)

### Testing Requirements

Before marking any feature as complete:
- [ ] Manual testing in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- [ ] Mobile responsive testing
- [ ] Accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility check
- [ ] Data accuracy validation

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Scripts Not Working

**Problem**: `./scripts/create-feature-issue.sh` fails with syntax errors
**Previous Cause**: macOS Bash 3.2 incompatibility (FIXED as of October 25, 2025)
**Solution**: Scripts now use POSIX-compliant syntax and work with Bash 3.2+
**Note**: If issues persist, use GitHub web interface for issue creation

### Broken Markdown Links

**Problem**: Cross-references not working in specs
**Cause**: Incorrect relative paths after file moves
**Solution**: Use pattern `../../[directory]/[file].md` from spec files

### GitHub Action Not Labeling

**Problem**: New issues not automatically labeled
**Cause**: Action requires proper title prefix (FEAT/ENH/BUG)
**Solution**: Ensure issue title starts with correct prefix
