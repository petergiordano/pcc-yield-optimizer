**Priority**: Medium (before demo)  
**Dependencies**: All previous sprints

**What to Build**:
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, fade-ins, slide-ups
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders, spinners, progress indicators
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages when no data/opportunities
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures, retry logic
- **Export Features**:
  - Export heatmap as PNG (for presentations)

## Recommended Build Order

### For MVP Demo (Investor Presentation)
1. ‚úÖ Sprint 1 (Foundation) - **DONE**
2. ‚úÖ Sprint 2 (Intelligence Layer) - **DONE**
3. ‚úÖ Sprint 3 (Opportunity List) - **DONE**
4. üî® Sprint 4 (Gap Grid) - **NEXT**
5. üî® Sprint 7 (Polish) - **BEFORE DEMO**
6. üî® Sprint 6 (Analysis Panel) - **NICE TO HAVE**
7. ‚è≠Ô∏è Sprint 5 (Map) - **SKIP FOR MVP**

**Rationale**: Gap Grid + Polish gives you 3 complete, polished views (Heatmap, List, Grid) that tell the full story. Map is impressive but takes longer and less critical for decision-making.

### For Full Feature Set (Post-Demo)
1. ‚úÖ Sprints 1-3 (complete)
2. üî® Sprint 4 (Gap Grid)
3. üî® Sprint 5 (Map)
4. üî® Sprint 6 (Analysis Panel)
5. üî® Sprint 7 (Polish)
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Sprint 8 (Advanced Features)

## Time Estimates

**MVP Demo Ready**: 2-3 more days
- Sprint 4: 1 day
- Sprint 7 (Partial): 1 day
- Buffer/testing: 0.5 days

**Full Feature Set**: 5-7 more days
- Sprint 4: 1 day
- Sprint 5: 2-3 days
- Sprint 6: 1 day
- Sprint 7: 1-2 days

## Success Checkpoints

After each sprint, verify:
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All interactions work as expected
- [ ] Visual quality matches design spec
- [ ] Performance meets targets (< 2 sec load, < 200ms interactions)
- [ ] Generates at least 1 new "aha!" insight
- [ ] Stakeholders can use without training

## Questions to Ask Before Building

For each sprint:
1. What's the core user need this solves?
2. What's the minimum viable version?
3. What can be deferred to a later sprint?
4. What data dependencies exist?
5. What's the biggest technical risk?
