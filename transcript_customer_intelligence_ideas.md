Date: Oct 

Speaker A: Pete
Speaker B: Bridget

Transcript:
 
Speaker A: Okay. All right, so we're looking at the PCC Yield Optimizer. I got to come up with a better name. It's going to be the Customer Intelligence center, the cic, which is what they use on battleships. Okay, so this. Let me just prompt you again, and maybe you can. Then now you can fire off your ideas and the things that we should be adding in. Okay. All right, so Heat Map View. This is showing us essentially the popular times through the Google Maps API. It's just showing us the different competitors and what times they're showing up busy or not. 
Speaker B: Right. Which is originally when we talked about this, I basically was like, who's winning the time slot? And then going to their website and. Or their Instagram to find out why are they winning that time slot. And so. 
Speaker A: And their website, you said their website. 
Speaker B: And their Instagram would probably be the two places. 
Speaker A: What about Facebook? 
Speaker B: I don't know. We could look. I mean, wherever they post their stuff, right. It might be Facebook, might be Instagram, might be their website. But, like, what are they offering. Offering in that flat? I think the other thing is it might be like this in the morning winds in residential areas, whereas lunchtime wins in. In corporate areas, and then evening wins back in residential. Right. Like, there might be some. 
Speaker A: Yeah. Pattern. 
Speaker B: Just patterns that say, it's not that they've got some amazing programming in the morning at Grant park. It's just everybody knows to go to Grant park in the morning because it's near their house or whatever. You know what I mean? Like, so some of it might be programming, some of it might be location. That was what I was talking about, the trade area. 
Speaker A: So what we're not gonna be able to get is. Oh, you know, we could do is we could ask the PCC customers if they're also a member of somewhere else and. Or if they play somewhere else so that we could start to see why. And when they play at those different. 
Speaker B: Locations, I think the other, like, the things I want to know is, who are the people that come to ours? And kind of like, we had that guy, Roland Raymond. 
Speaker A: Randall. 
Speaker B: Randall. And he lived near there, so he was going on a Saturday or whatever. But even though he lived near there, he went to the place in the city because it was fun, and it was like a fun Friday. 
Speaker A: They had an event. 
Speaker B: Correct. So it's sort of like, what are the variables that would make someone come to our thing? And so amenities is one thing that I think we could be like. 
Speaker A: How. 
Speaker B: Much of it is that it's more of A what did someone call it? Sport attainment or whatever? It was like, oh yeah, remember that word? But there was some word. But basically it's like playertainment. Who knows? Anyway, the point is it's like basically people want it to be more social so they want to play and then they want to hang out. And if that's. 
Speaker A: Some people do. Not everybody. 
Speaker B: Some people, but that's what I'm trying to understand also are most of the people that go there, most of the people that go to PCC now, like, like that guy Randall, like pickleball is their life. They go because they are good and they like to play everywhere they can and be in tournaments and all of that. Like, what percent of our, what percent of the people that go to PCC is it like 75 are like pickleball obsessed and play everywhere and anywhere and you know, like, whatever, because they're good. And how many people are more socially oriented and they're just going to like kind of sort of hang out? They're not that good. It's something to do. Like who brings their own people who just shows up, like, just trying to get a better understanding. The demos that we have, like, Chris and Christy are asking Quinn to put together a high school league. Like, why are there high schools nearby? Is that like, is that because it's good recurring revenue because they can work with the high school? 
Speaker A: Or maybe it's if they're younger, their parents have to pick them up. 
Speaker B: Or Maybe there's something B2B or like this is where I was also saying, like, are there a bunch of local businesses nearby where you could offer like, hey, for morale? Like, you know, on Tuesday nights we have corporate night and it's like BYO group, you know, like, but, but let's. What are the. It's sort of like, who do we attract today and who don't we attract? And should we. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: So like, do we not attract singletons? Do we not attract like beginners? Like, what are the groups of people? And then are they going somewhere else? And is that where we're like, it's beginner night every Friday night or it's an all level night every Friday night and like we're missing out because people are too intimidated to come to us or like, I just don't have a good sense of that. And when I asked Kristen Christy who comes here? They were like, everyone. But maybe we could be like, who comes here on Saturdays? Who comes here in the morning? Who comes in the afternoon? Like, maybe there is a bit of a Day. 
Speaker A: Part of. Yes, I think that is. I think that's why part of the conversation I want to have with Christy tomorrow. I think one of the most important things to do is just start asking some questions of the people when they come up, when they come in. 
Speaker B: Right. Because it also is like housewives, like stay at home moms. Is that a big category? And basically stay at home moms, they all, like, they certainly are working out during the middle of the day. Right. Like, and are they basically looking to like, do that, then go to lunch or meet up or whatever? And like, do we have the stay at home mom crowd or not? And. And if we don't, is there. Is it possible to get them or where are they going? And what do they wish that we had? Right. Like, because if our utilization isn't actually great, from two to whatever. And maybe that's actually because there's school pickup, you know, or like, we just kind of need to get a little bit into the minds of the groups that either that we agree or that we wish we had. What group do we wish we had that we don't? 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: Like, it makes me think of Chicago Social Club, like, kind of like the idea they have for Quinn with high schools. How do we get in with Chicago Social Club and have like one night be dedicated to Chicago Social Club members? 
Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, maybe that's already there, but. 
Speaker B: But let's get back to bowling night. 
Speaker A: So, okay, these. These opportunities, this is like, you know, it identifies something and launch the campaign. I think that's okay. But what's really important, the launch of. 
Speaker B: Campaign doesn't really make sense to me or work because it's all about doing something creative and interesting. So you can't just hit launch the campaign. Like, you've got to. 
Speaker A: Well, this is an idea. Yeah, well, remember, it's. This is just a demo. So it's trying to give you an outline and then we decide what we want to do with this. Maybe this then gets put into a document and then. Or a template that can be used and then you edit it, you make something up or whatever. It's just trying to. It's just trying to tell you, hey, launch a Saturday social league at 12pm and partner with the local cafe. It's just trying to give you ideas. But I think part of what we're missing is I just don't think that. 
Speaker B: Extra thing that's the answer to everything. I would just pull it out of this. This is just about coming up with ideas and then elsewhere somewhere else would be like Here's a tool to, like, use Gemini to come up with a. Like, vo could come up with content, and then. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: You know what I mean? 
Speaker A: Yeah. Well, yes. But, yes. And those things can all be programmatically done. And so if we can. 
Speaker B: I just don't think they need to be in this. 
Speaker A: Like, not at the beginning. No, no, they don't need to be in this. It could be, because then you could actually then wire in maybe whatever video model you want to use or whatever. But it could give a spec. The thing that's important is that maybe it pushes out a prompt and says, here's the prompt for the video to create. Right. So I'm just trying to reduce the friction. Right. Like, if you're going to. That's also when you're doing lots and lots and lots of these things. If you're only doing one in a while, it doesn't matter. But I get your point. Your point is this should be generating ideas, and then there's got to be this next step of actually creating a campaign, which I agree. This is just, again, art of the possible. It's not saying this is gonna happen or not. It's just an example. The whole purpose is to decide, right. Should it be in the thing or not. That's all that is. Okay, so there's all that. And basically what this is trying to help you do is just look a little bit more deeply at the opportunities. And. And this one here is trying to show you, like, how much can you actually start to add to your weekly opportunity? And again, these two things are very similar. They're kind of two different views of the same thing. And so what do you think about a planning thing like this, where it gives you a grid and with some opportunities to schedule things? And, I mean, maybe it's the same idea, right? 
Speaker B: Like. 
Speaker A: This is the gap analysis view. 
Speaker B: Yeah. 
Speaker A: What about. 
Speaker B: I think, like, don't try and make this thing do everything. I think make it do what it's good at, which is analyzing opportunities, and then also. 
Speaker A: But go deep at the opportunities. That's what I'm trying to say. Right now, the only information I'm using is the busy time. So what are the other things? What are the other data that you're saying we can use? Like, so you're saying that's where you get the Instagram feed. And. 
Speaker B: Well, I want to understand. I mean, not only for these competitors, I actually would be curious because you could. What are the most popular pickleball places in the U.S. what programs do they have, like, we don't need to be limited to those 15 miles around for ID. Agree, agree. 
Speaker A: I thought about that. 
Speaker B: Like, we could be like, yeah, yeah, what are amazing ideas? Right? And it could be like, well, that's. 
Speaker A: Almost like a perplexity search or something that is doing an exhaustive search of the top thousand. 
Speaker B: Well, and what it could do is be like, here's a bunch of beginner ideas and it could come up with a bunch of beginner ideas and so that we can basically have things to draw from. 
Speaker A: Oh, that's interesting. So you almost like create a. A list of event types. Yeah, beginner, intermediate, whatever. Then there's a Halloween, you know, like if we go to. 
Speaker B: I mean, and this also could be around the demo where it could be like, we're going after beginners, we're going after advanced. And then it also could be demos of like, this is the calendar. 
Speaker A: I mean, look at this is. By the way, this is all. This is just a screenshot. There's nothing here. You can't click on anything. You can't do anything. But this is like youth programming, LinkedIn event, Chicken Anger, chicken finger challenge. So this is what they, they have in here now. 
Speaker B: But you can't click on it to participate. 
Speaker A: No, can't do anything. 
Speaker B: So. 
Speaker A: But that's a different problem. Don't worry about that. What I'm getting at here is that Bridget. So part of the way, I think because I'm an engineer and because you actually have to convert it into software is the way to get leverage is when you're able to create like what's called a taxonomy that you can then bucket these things into so then you can make use of it. And so part of what you're saying. 
Speaker B: Is. 
Speaker A: What if we looked across the US and looked at what are the top 100 events that are being run anywhere in the US just scour Instagram, Facebook, whatever, X and identify the websites of those companies and then look for. When they post something new and look to see if there's anything in the world that tells you that the event was a success or not. So following the hashtag. Right. Of the pickleball. So probably means we need a list of all the pickleball clubs. We need a list of all the handles for social media. Like if it was CC on Instagram. 
Speaker B: Yeah, Hashtags are dead. 
Speaker A: Not hashtags. The handle. The ention. 
Speaker B: Well, yes, and I actually think the question is, can you tap into somewhat your. The same data that you've already looked at, but just do it in a More like what? Data your Google map data. Your. And try and understand the busiest pickleball clubs. The busiest pickleball clubs in each major city or in. 
Speaker A: Oh, that's an interesting idea. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: So, so find. So, so get a list of the top. You know they call them, they call them NFL cities. It's anywhere that an NFL has a team, a football team. It's like 30 something cities. So you look at those and then you look like you said, you look at the top 20, 30 or whatever, pickleball. And then look at all their popular times and see. But I think, don't you think it's going to be somewhat similar? It's all going to be within a certain range, you know what I'm saying? 
Speaker B: I'm not trying to look at their popular times. I'm trying to use that to understand the best clubs out there and then go look at what they're doing. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: So if we're like, like what is the. I'm trying to think, you know, like there's bars that are hot. 
Speaker A: Okay. 
Speaker B: Okay. Like restaurants that are hot. And then you go, let's look at the menu. 
Speaker A: Okay. So let me put this another way. So another one would be to search again. So let's get a list of all these clubs, then run the popular times function to look at the ones that are the absolute redlining. They're just the busiest of all. That gives us a smaller set. Then go do research on them to find out what are some of the things that they're doing. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: Is that right? Is that what you were trying to get to? 
Speaker B: And so like the one I have. 
Speaker A: To convert your ideas into practical steps that can then be followed. 
Speaker B: Right. So in general, what I am trying to do is figure out who's already figured out something and copy it. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: And I'm also trying to figure out who do we have and what, what. 
Speaker A: Should we be doing with the people. 
Speaker B: We have and who don't we have? But we should. Based on our trade area. So should we have a bunch of stay at home moms based on our trade area? Should we have a bunch of people, corporate people, based on our trade area? Like I am unclear. Based on our, like I don't understand that area. 
Speaker A: I'm getting the demographic information. 
Speaker B: Right. But I'm just saying once you, Once we knew if we're like f. All the stay at home moms go to the Y because they all. Or like they go to the Bay Club concept because they all belong to the Bay Club. 
Speaker A: It's Midtown. 
Speaker B: Okay. Midtown but you got what I'm kind of saying, like, if every freaking stay at home mom belongs to Midtown, and so we're just never gonna get those people, then maybe we're like, fine, we're not gonna get those people. Right? Like, but, like, so this pickleball place I went in New York was called the Glass House, and it's downtown New York, and it's huge. And my guess is they do a lot of corporate events, right? Like. Like, they're known for corporate events. Like, I'm just trying to understand. We could do lots of things. We could do this high school idea. We could do corporate events. We could do Santa Moms. We could do Super. 
Speaker A: Yeah, but you don't know. 
Speaker B: But I am unclear. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: Based on the. And this is where Chris and Chrissy have this magical, like, real estate brain who should be coming to ours. Who did they think was going to come? Who's. What's the thesis? And then who actually came? And what's that gap? 
Speaker A: Well, because you can either. 
Speaker B: You could be like, I had no idea we're going to end up being like, a more elite pickleball club clubhouse. Then we could really, really lean into that. 
Speaker A: Why? 
Speaker B: But also, if we're really missing, like, some demo that we should have, let's better understand why. 
Speaker A: Yeah. Yes. This also made me think. Even. We don't even have a simple histogram of. So look at your customers and then the number of times that they show up in a week or in a month, like, we don't even know who are most. They probably know intuitively because they see them often. But we actually don't know. And we don't know. 
Speaker B: Well, they kind of. It's a fight club. 
Speaker A: No, not necessarily that. Those are people that are. I'm just saying that. Is it that we don't know? We don't know. We need to. What we need to do is. That's one of the number one things I want to ask Christy is we need a way to start identifying the person when they're in there, how long they're there, and actually how much of that time is spent on the court versus other things. Well, you have to know that. 
Speaker B: But all I think the other more maybe slightly more important thing is how many times are, like, just like, membership. 
Speaker A: And so it's covered. 
Speaker B: Like, they could come one time, they could come a thousand times. 
Speaker A: Yes, yes. 
Speaker B: Versus if they're spending more money on ladders and all those things. So, like, how valuable are these different groups? 
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. 
Speaker B: I mean, to your point, they're also taking up space. So good, bad, or ugly, like, then that means we. That court is not available for someone else. 
Speaker A: Yeah, I am. I am working on that also. Which is another. It's another project which will be. It will be. Where's my app? There's an. Basically, take a look at all the offerings. You have event court, like tournament, corporate event, private event. You have a training session. You have, you know, a youth, whatever it is. All those things compete for each other in the court space. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: And so that I already wrote up product requirements document for that. And the interesting thing is a lot of this is already figured out, like, the math and all that, because hotels have to do this, airplanes have to do this. This is just a yield management issue. We just have to categorize what are the things that we offer. And then, you know, then you start developing data and then you can start making decisions about, hey, we ran three corporate events this. This month. That's kind of the limit for us because we need to make sure that we have time for all of these other members. 
Speaker B: But there's also a thing about, like, if we're dead from two to six every single day, then, yeah, then we can be like, all right, that's when we do corporate events, but we only offer them during 2 to 6. Or that's when we. Right. Like, that's when you're like, all right, what can we do? Two to six, you know, and. 
Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually. Yeah, this is like 60. What is this? 
Speaker B: Can I make a recommendation for your meeting tomorrow? 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: I would tell Christy that you've and Chris that you've nerded out over a bunch of data. Tell them it. What the data the source is. But that's. Then just ask them, like, what questions do you have? 
Speaker A: I don't think they know. 
Speaker B: All right. 
Speaker A: I honestly don't think that they know. 
Speaker B: What they don't. You're gonna. 
Speaker A: Like, I won't do. I won't go into. No, that's not gonna happen. Why. Why would they be freaked out? 
Speaker B: I don't know. It's overwhelming is what I mean. I think it's very overwhelming. 
Speaker A: Well, that I can imagine. But I. I can do a good job of saying there's nothing you need to worry about. Like, there's nothing that there's nothing. I mean, maybe what. Maybe what you mean is they'll feel overwhelmed because they'll realize how much they don't know. 
Speaker B: I think it's like they'll. I think they're gonna be like, oh, God, Pete's going deep. Like, he's going overboard. Like, what is this? 
Speaker A: Well, so I know. I already, I just told her. I already told her. I said, this is just an example of some of the things that are possible to help you understand the reason behind some of the data that I'd like to get from you. That's it. And some of the things that we can do with information. Bridget, I really. I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but when I look at the website, they're just decisions. It tells me that there's just a lack of nothing against them. Like, they said, this is their first time doing it. They don't have any experience. 
Speaker B: No, I agree. They could use some direction. 
Speaker A: So that's it. And maybe that's really the first, most important area is simply make it about, hey, we got to get this website and you know, put together. And I, you know, I could. I could find somebody I know I can that could help us with that. I think the other is like, I. 
Speaker B: Think what you could say is sort of like there's a bit of an order of operations. And, and what I don't want you to think is that anybody's expecting you to, like, do a thousand things. It's more like this information helps us figure out what's the most important thing to do. Yeah, first. Yeah, next. Yeah, next. 
Speaker A: Look, I just. What I want to do is simply show. I wired in one data source and from a single data source, look what we can do. So imagine the kinds of things that we can do if we just collect a little bit more information about the customer. Customer here, customer there. That's it. I'm not gonna research, doc. I have all of it. It's in a. It's in a notebook that I sent to Chris and Christy. 
Speaker B: But did it talk about the types of events or the types of customer review? 
Speaker A: Yeah, I had all of that in there. 
Speaker B: Well, then we may already have the answers that I'm asking for. 
Speaker A: Well, sort of. I have. It doesn't. It's more industry centric and it doesn't. Look, you have to go through the. You have to go through the report and then you have to tell it. You have to be like, hey, create a mies categorized set of amenities. Because what starts happening is they start comparing things and then they use different terms. Like they'll say, oh, a locker room here or a spa here or this or that. I'm like, no, no, no, no. These are all different things. So you have to go back into the deep research and then you have to out of that extract like you have to create in order to actually be able to make inferences. You need to help the AI use a categorization system where things don't overlap so that when you say one thing, you mean that thing. And that's called MIES. Mutually exclusive. Completely exhaustive. It's a categorization scheme. 90% of what McKinsey makes their money on. I understand they call it mey mey and so. 
Speaker B: Okay, Pete, you're over explaining to me. I'm just telling you you can do whatever you want. But I'm just warning you, that's all. 
Speaker A: What are you warning me about? 
Speaker B: Just how to couch it with them. 
Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
