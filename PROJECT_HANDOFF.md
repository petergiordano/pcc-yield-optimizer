## Project Overview

**Product**: PCC Yield Optimizer - Competitive Intelligence & Yield Management Dashboard  
**Client**: Pickleball Clubhouse Chicago (4242 N. Elston Ave, Chicago, IL)  
**Goal**: Drive membership from 236 â†’ 400 members while optimizing revenue per court-hour

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform competitive and operational data into actionable strategic decisions using visual analytics that identify when PCC has capacity but competitors are busy.

---

## Strategic Context

### Business Model (Current State)
- **Revenue Mix**: 36.8% Membership | 34.8% Court Reservations | 11.9% Instruction | 10.9% Events | 5% Pro Shop
- **Expense Mix**: 37.2% Payroll | 37.2% Debt Service | 10.6% Marketing
- **Current Members**: 236-240 (Target: 400)
- **Member Tiers**: Casual ($85/mo), Game Changer ($125/mo), Fanatic ($185/mo), Fight Club (legacy)

### Key Business Priorities
1. **Membership Growth**: Identify where potential members play instead of PCC and why
2. **Yield Optimization**: Balance member play vs. non-member revenue (events, instruction, corporate)
3. **Maintain Quality**: Keep member NPS at 92+ (99th percentile)

### Competitive Landscape
**Primary Competitors**:
- **SPF Chicago** (2600 N. Southport): 8 courts, social/lifestyle brand, excellent transit (3 min walk), no parking, strong cafÃ©/bar
- **Big City Pickle - West Loop** (1015 W. Madison): 10 courts, downtown location, restaurant/bar focus, paid parking
- **Pickle Haus** (Arlington Heights): 12 courts, suburban, family-friendly, large free parking

**PCC Advantages**: Superior courts, free parking (45 spaces), value pricing, true club feel, excellent instruction  
**PCC Challenges**: Limited amenities vs. SPF, parking challenges during highway construction, brand awareness

### Key Data Models

**Facility Schema** (see `data/facilities.json`):
- Basic info: name, address, coordinates, rating, courts
- Amenities: cafÃ©, bar, parking, pro shop
- Transit: nearest station, walk time, bus routes
- Segments: breakdown by player type (competitive, fitness, social, families)

**Popular Times Schema** (see `data/popular-times/*.json`):
- Weekly data: 7 days Ã— 24 hours
- Popularity scale: 0-100
- Based on Google Popular Times API patterns

**Opportunity Scoring Algorithm**:
```javascript
// High opportunity = Low PCC utilization + High competitor demand
if (pccUtilization < 60 && competitorMax > 75) {
  score = (competitorMax - pccUtilization) / 5; // 0-10 scale
  level = score > 7 ? 'high' : score > 5 ? 'medium' : 'low';
  estimatedCustomers = gap Ã— 0.6; // Conservative
}
```

## Key Insights from Sprints 1-3

### What's Working Well
1. **Visual clarity**: Opportunity overlays make patterns instantly visible
2. **Actionable recommendations**: Specific, time-bound suggestions resonate with users
3. **Filter flexibility**: Users can drill down to exactly what they need
4. **Export functionality**: CSV export enables offline analysis and team sharing

### Lessons Learned
1. **Don't make users think**: The heatmap comparison was overwhelming until we added overlays
2. **Quantify everything**: "~48 potential customers" is more compelling than "high opportunity"
3. **Context matters**: Tooltips need to explain WHY something is an opportunity, not just that it is
4. **Multiple views needed**: Different roles need different lenses on the same data

### Technical Decisions
1. **Vanilla JS over React**: Simpler for demo, faster to build, no build step
2. **Client-side only**: No backend = easier deployment, faster iteration
3. **JSON files**: Real-time API integration deferred to post-demo
4. **Tailwind utilities**: Rapid styling without CSS bloat
